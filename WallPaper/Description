This set of scripts downloads a wallpaper from the link placed in "setup.bash", sets it as the current wallpaper, and installs a LaunchAgent to constantly set the wallpaper. This directory includes the neccesary file to create the intitial application and remove it.

The "Create" directory contains the following:

#setup.bash
* Creates a hidden directory
* Downloads specified image file and moves it into the hidden directory
* Sets the picture to the desktop background
* Copies the "setpaper.sh" script into the hidden directory
* Writes the LaunchAgent that starts "setpaper.sh" on login

#setpaper.sh
* Sets the hidden directory to our current working directory
* Hashes the wallpaper we set
* Loops a check of the current wallpapers hash. If it doesn't match our set wallpaper, we re-set the wallpaper and hash.

#sampleicon.icns
* Sample icon intended as a placeholder for creation of application using [Sveinbjorn Thordarson's Platypus](https://github.com/sveinbjornt/Platypus).
* Converted from .png to .icns using [offdrive](https://offdrive.com/convert/png/icns).
